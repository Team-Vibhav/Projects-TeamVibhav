## Description of the Project
* AR can be used to project virtual objects on targeted area. This technology can be used to make 3-D visualisers which can show various 3-D curves generated through their equations, like conic sections as an example. Through this project a student can see the real time generated 3-D models of the conic just by entering the equation of that particular conic section. So learning 3-D curves and conic sections will be easier. 

## Learning Outcomes: -
*   We learned about the working of AR and technology related to it. Also learned  about the  Unity engine and C# language.

## Social Benefits:-
*	The students will get a better understanding of mathematical curves and conic sections.
