## Description of the Project
* This is a mini portable solar power plant that is based on a sunflower model. This is a model which receives maximum sunlight and it saves a lot of space as compared to other solar plants.



## Learning Outcomes: -
* How to use LDR Sensor
* How to work with servo motors
