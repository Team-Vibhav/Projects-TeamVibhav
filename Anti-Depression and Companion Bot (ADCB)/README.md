## Description of the Project
* The life of people working in corporate sector and students who are studying in cities far from home is quite lonely. Depression is a real problem out there and cost thousands of human lives per year. The main motive behind building this bot is to cure that problem and help people to live a peaceful life. The bot will be established or will be set up on the work desk/Study table so that it will continuously monitor the facial expression of the person sitting on the desk with help of OpenCV and will analyze it with help of Google Cloud services over a period of time to determine whether the person is depressed or angry. The bot will also remind the person sitting on the desk to smile, talk to family or will help cure their depression using happy quotes. In case the person doesnâ€™t follow advice then the bot will send the condition to guardian/HR in case of student and office workers etc.
Also this bot will act as a companion by answering any query generated by the user.

## Learning Outcomes: -
*	Will learn to implement Python libraries like OpenCV, Tensor Flow, Pillow etc.
*	Will learn to use Google cloud vision.
*	Will learn to Use Raspberry Pi on much advanced scale

## Social Benefits:-
*	Will save valuable human lives which are lost every year due to depression
*	Will provide a companion bot to people who are living alone
